# AWS LocalStack Terraform

This project demonstrates how to use AWS LocalStack with Terraform to create a local development environment that simulates AWS services for testing and development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/umeshkvguptha/aws-localstack-terraform.git
   cd aws-localstack-terraform


1. Start AWS LocalStack and any required services using Docker Compose:
   ```shell
   ./start-localstack.sh
   
2. Deploy your Terraform infrastructure to the LocalStack environment:
      ```shell
   ./deploy-terraform.sh
3. Interact with your simulated AWS services locally.
4. When you're done testing, tear down the infrastructure:
   ```shell
   ./destroy-terraform.sh


## Configuration
Modify main.tf, variables.tf, and terraform.tfvars to define your desired infrastructure resources. Ensure that you use LocalStack endpoint URLs for services you want to simulate.
For LocalStack configuration, see docker-compose.yml.
Example Usage
Include example code snippets or usage scenarios here to help users understand how to work with your Terraform configurations in the LocalStack environment.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:

## Ensure that Docker is running and accessible.
Verify that the LocalStack Docker container is up and running.
Double-check your Terraform configurations and make sure they point to the correct LocalStack endpoints.
